Use heat.exe WiX tool to get all directories needed for installation to include them in the final .wxs from the Visual Studio project.

In VS:
1. Tools->External Tools
2. "Add", fill the fields with these values:

------
Harvest Project Content Fragments
heat.exe
project $(ProjectFileName) -pog Content -ag -template fragment -out $(TargetName)-Content-Fragments.wxs -ke -v
$(ProjectDir)
------

3. Check "Use Output window"
4. OK
5. Select the project
6. Tools->"Harvest Project Content Fragments"
7. After harvesting check the <ProjetName>-Content-Fragments.wxs file. It should contain fragments for components and directories included in the project. If nothing add directories to the VS project first:
  1. In Solution Explorer -> "Show All Files"
  2. Rightclick on directory to include
  3. Select "Include In Project"
