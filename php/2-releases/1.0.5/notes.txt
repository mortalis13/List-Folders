== Usage ==

1. Paste a directory path in the first field.
2. Add extensions to 'Filter Extensions' to include only files with specified extensions.
3. Add extensions to 'Exclude Extensions' to exclude files with these extensions (the 'Filter Extensions' text will be ignored).
4. Add folder names (that are subfolders or current directory from the path) to 'Filter Directories' to include only these directories.
5. Select 'Export Options'
  - 'Export Text' - creates .txt file with the directory structure in the 'export/text' folder.
  - 'Export Markup' - creates .html file with the same text as for the 'Export Text' but with wrapped directory/file names in appropriate <span> elements. The file is created in the 'export/markup' folder.
  - 'Export Tree' - creates two files: .html in the 'export/tree' subfolder of the project main folder and .json in the 'export/tree/json' subfolder.
  The .html file can be run directly to view the scanned directory content in the tree format. It uses jsTree plugin for jQuery to give representation and interaction of a file tree on the HTML page.
5. If 'Export Tree' is selected additional field 'Export Tree name' appears. You may set your name which will be given to .html and .json files in the 'export/tree' folder when the tree view is exported. Or leave it blank to use the selected directory as the Tree name.
6. Press 'Scan Directory'.
7. After scanning you should see the text output of the directory structure on the current page. And check the selected folder and 'export/tree' folder for created files.


== Manage Options ==

1. To save current path and filters enter name in the field and press Add.
2. To load a saved option select a name from the list.
3. To remove a saved option select a name and press Remove.


== Problems ==

Detected problems with russian and spanish folder names.
1. If root folder has russian symbols the scanning fails (scandir()).
2. If root folder is in english and has russian subfolders all should be well (russian subfolder scans correctly).
3. For spanish folders (root/subfolder) this isn't true.
4. Spanish files inside folders render correctly but the inner substitution occurs (ñ->n, á->a, ...)
